This code was developed for the thesis entitled: "A contribution to the dynamics of epilepsy: identification and control for seizure attenuation" and then published in Neural Computing:

João Angelo Ferres Brogin, Jean Faber, Douglas Domingues Bueno; Burster Reconstruction Considering Unmeasurable Variables in the Epileptor Model. Neural Comput 2021; 33 (12): 3288–3333. doi: https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01443

Essentially, the code was developed on the Spyder platform and it consists four separate files: the main code contains the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta integrator to obtain both the estimated and actual states (RK4_observer_Epileptor.py); an optimization problem routine based on the concept of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) co compute the gains of the observer (LMIs_observer_Epileptor.py); another Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta integrator used for the mass-spring system, as a complementary result to analyze the efficiency of the parameter beta, proposed in the article (RK4_controller_mass_spring.py); at last, the code for its Linear Matrix Inequalities, defined as an optimization problem (LMIs_controller_mass_spring.py).
